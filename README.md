# Code Refactoring for Horiseon Marketing Page

## Description
This repository contains the refactored code for Horiseon marketing agency. It has been a longtime dream of mine to work with a prestigious marketing agency, so I was thrilled when Horiseon contacted me about refactoring the code for their landing page. Who wouldn't want to improve SEO for the top SEO improvers in the space?! Surely, this says a lot about my reputation as a developer that they would reach out to me. Nevertheless, the challenge of working on this process did not lean on my community rapport, but rather my abilities as a dev. The process involved creating a codebase to follow accessibility standards in order optimize the site for search engines. Along the way, I learned the importance of semantics, logical structure, and code consolidation/clean-up. It was an arduous journey, but a truly fulfilling experience that I am ecstatic to share. ðŸ˜Š
